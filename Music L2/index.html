I'm getting older, I think I'm aging well<br>
I wish someone had told me I'd be doing this by myself<br>
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for<br>
But it's different when a stranger's always waiting at your door<br>
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more<br>
Than anyone before (anyone before)<br>
Too bad they're usually deranged<br><br>

Last week, I realized I crave pity<br>
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse<br>
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing<br>
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed<br>
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest, I was still being ignored<br>
(Lying for attention just to get neglection)<br>
Now we're estranged<br><br>

Things I once enjoyed (ah-ah)<br>
Just keep me employed now<br>
Things I'm longing for<br>
Someday, I'll be bored of<br>
It's so weird<br>
That we care so much until we don't<br><br>

I'm getting older, I've got more on my shoulders<br>
But I'm getting better at admitting when I'm wrong<br>
I'm happier than ever, at least that's my endeavor<br>
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure<br>
'Cause to be honest, I just wish that what I promise<br>
Would depend on what I'm given (not on his permission)<br>
(Wasn't my decision) to be abused, mmm<br><br>

Things I once enjoyed<br>
Just keep me employed now<br>
Things I'm longing for, mmh<br>
Someday, I'll be bored of<br>
It's so weird<br>
That we care so much until we don't<br><br>

But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing<br>
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine<br>
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna<br>
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time<br>
