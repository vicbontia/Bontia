When I'm away from you <br>
I'm happier than ever<br>
Wish I could explain it better<br>
I wish it wasn't true, mm-hmm<br>
Give me a day or two<br>
To think of something clever<br>
To write myself a letter<br>
To tell me what to do, mm-hmm<br><br>

Do you read my interviews? Or do you skip my avenue?<br>
When you said you were passing through, was I even on your way?<br>
I knew when I asked you to be cool about what I was telling you<br>
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do<br>
And I'd end up more afraid<br>
Don't say it isn't fair<br>
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh<br>
So if you really wanna know<br><br>

When I'm away from you (when I'm away from you)<br>
I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)<br>
Wish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better)<br>
I wish it wasn't true, mm-hmm<br><br>

You called me again, drunk in your Benz<br>
Driving home under the influence<br>
You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath<br>
'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends<br>
I don't relate to you<br>
I don't relate to you, no<br>
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty<br>
You make me hate this city<br><br>

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet<br>
Never told anyone anything bad<br>
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything<br>
And all that you did was make me fucking sad<br>
So don't waste the time I don't have<br>
Don't try to make me feel bad<br>
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time<br>
But I'd have an empty line, 'cause you never did<br>
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I<br>
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid<br><br>

You ruined everything good<br>
Always said you were misunderstood<br>
Made all my moments your own<br>
Just fucking leave me alone<br>
